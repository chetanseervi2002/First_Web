<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! My name is Chetan Pukhraj Choudhary, and I am a passionate and driven individual with a keen interest in
  technology, software development, and learning new things every day. I have a strong background in Java programming,
  cybersecurity, cryptography, and image processing, and I am currently expanding my knowledge in Flutter, Data
  Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Deep Learning, Generative AI, and Full Stack Software Development.
</p>

<p>I am currently pursuing my studies at Bikaner Technical University, where I focus on computer science-related
  subjects. My learning journey has led me to explore various domains, including compiler design, IoT, artificial
  intelligence, and cybersecurity. I enjoy breaking down complex topics into simple, understandable concepts, which
  helps me grasp things better and also allows me to assist others in their learning process.

  One of my favorite areas in computer science is cryptography and cybersecurity. I find encryption techniques like MD5,
  RSA, AES, and Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA) fascinating, as they play a crucial role in protecting digital information.
  Additionally, I have explored network security topics, including HTTPS, IPsec, email security, malicious software, and
  digital signatures, which have deepened my understanding of how to build secure systems</p>

<p>One of my major projects includes developing a News App using Java, Retrofit API, and XML layouts. This project
  helped me enhance my Android development skills, understand API integration, and improve my problem-solving abilities.
  Besides Java, I am also diving into Flutter development, which enables me to create cross-platform applications with
  an elegant UI/UX design.

  Here are some of the key skills I have gained:<br>
  ✔ Programming Languages: Java, Python, Dart (Flutter)<br>
  ✔ Development Tools & Frameworks: Android Studio, Retrofit API, Flutter<br>
  ✔ Cybersecurity & Cryptography: RSA, AES, Secure Hash Algorithm, Digital Signatures<br>
  ✔ Image Processing: Fourier Transform, Histogram Processing, Pseudo Coloring Models<br>
  ✔ Full Stack Development: (Currently Learning).</p>
